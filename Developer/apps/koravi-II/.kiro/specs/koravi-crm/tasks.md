# Implementation Plan

**IMPORTANT**: After completing each task, ensure the development server runs without issues and the app is viewable in the browser. Each task should result in a working, demonstrable feature that can be previewed immediately.

**COMPONENT STRATEGY**: This implementation uses a hybrid approach:
- **shadcn/ui components** for forms, dialogs, cards, and standard UI elements (using MCP server)
- **Liquid Glass React** for navigation elements (sidebar, topbar) with glassmorphism effects
- **Custom components** where needed to bridge between libraries or add specific functionality
